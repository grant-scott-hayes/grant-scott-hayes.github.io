      <h1> Learning Plan</h1>
      
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>I would like to remain in the Fintech space, perhaps in an organisation that utilises my knowledge in the fund/financial services industry however alsoopen to anything bank, payments,
        or finance-operations. An ideal scenario would be a position that has the felxibility of significant periods of remote work should I require that flexibility. 
      </p>

      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>I have a good track record in being able to learn new subjects and to apply that kwnoledge. I am a good listener and am able to follow step-by-step instructions well.
        I sometimes have trouble when I am presented with very unfamiliar material and seem to take a bit longer than otehrs to grasp the meaning. Therefore, sometimes I do not
        do well in a time-crunch if I don't have a reasonable understanding of the issue or problem domain. 
      </p>

      <h2>Non-technical skills</h2>
      <p>As an ongoing project, I will continue to challenge myself and work on my resilience under pressure. Once aspect of Dev Academy that appealed
        ofr this reason was the Bootcamp phase. In many regards it is a test of the work I have put in in the last few years.
      </p>


      <h2>My Committment</h2>
      <p>I have a dedicated workspace to complete the work and having others rely on me will keep me on track to be available.</p>
      <p>I have been following strict improvements to my diet, excercise, and home environment to be the optimal for the upcoming bootcamp phase. I have 
        prepared an exclusive study area and will not be distracted in that zone. I have the apps on my mobile so will be available most times, even while away from a PC.</p>
      <p>I expect to be at the computer most days from 9am and will complete work systematically, and will aim to complete the agreed tasks for the day.</p>

      <h3>Seeking help</h3>
      <p>I have had issues with stress in the past however that significantly improved in recent years and I have managed extremely stressful events since. 
        I will contact the facilitator, should any roadblocks come up.</p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>I would expect the faciliation team to offer experience, guidance, and reality checks; especially to help teams out of any rabbit-holes.</p>

      <h2>Block-outs</h2>
      <p>None at this time.</p>
