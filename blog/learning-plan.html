      <h1> Learning Plan - Foundations</h1>
      
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to remain in the Fintech space, perhaps in an organisation that utilises my knowledge in the fund/financial services industry however also open to anything bank, payments,
        or finance-operations. An ideal scenario would be a position that has the flexibility of significant periods of remote work (should I require that flexibility). 
      </p>

      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>
        I have a good track record in being able to learn new subjects and to apply that kwowledge. I am a good listener and am able to follow step-by-step instructions well.
        I sometimes have trouble when I am presented with very unfamiliar material and seem to take a bit longer than others to grasp the meaning; in that regard my cofidence
        can wane. Therefore, sometimes I do not do well in a time-crunch and find myself 'avoiding' if I don't have a reasonable understanding of the issue or problem domain. 
      </p>

      <h2>Non-technical skills</h2>
      <p>
        As an ongoing project, I will continue to challenge myself and work on my resilience under pressure. One aspect of Dev Academy that appealed
        for this very reason was the Bootcamp phase. In many regards it is a test of the work I have put in in the last few years overcoming stress-related issues
        and perservering to get the job done!
      </p>


      <h2>My Committment</h2>
      <p>
        I have a dedicated workspace to complete the work and having others rely on me will keep me on track to be available.<br> I have been following strict improvements to my diet, excercise, and home environment to be the optimal for the upcoming bootcamp phase. I have 
        prepared an exclusive study area and will not be distracted in that zone. I have the apps on my mobile so will be available most times, even while away from a PC.<br>I expect to be at the computer most days from 8:45am and will complete work systematically and be honest if I'm struggling. I will aim to complete the agreed 
        task-list when I promise to do so and keep others informed if that slipping.
      </p>

      <h3>Seeking help</h3>
      <p>
        I have had issues with stress in the past however that significantly improved in recent years and I have managed extremely stressful events since and I'm proud of the 
        resiliance I've shown. I will contact the facilitator, should any roadblocks come up.
      </p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I would expect the faciliation team to offer experience, guidance, and reality checks; especially to help teams out of any rabbit-holes and to assist with technical roadblocks.
      </p>

      <h2>Block-outs</h2>
      <p>
        My calendar is clear so , none at this time in the bootcamp phase.
      </p>


      <h1>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>
      
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to remain in the Fintech space, perhaps in an organisation that utilises my knowledge in the fund/financial services industry however also open to anything bank, payments,
        or finance-operations. An ideal scenario would be a position that has the flexibility of significant periods of remote work (should I require that flexibility). <br><br>
        I also have in mind to start my own business based on a nifty fintech-y idea.
      </p>


       <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strength, perhaps, will be my ability to break down an issue and step through problem bit by bit and not get bogged dwon with the big picture. Additionally, in the past,
        I think I am good an facillitating a discussion where all voices get an opportunity to chip in.  
      </p>

      <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      <p>
        Self-confidence can affect my motivation and perserverance so one challenege will be to keep pushing on when I'm feeling despondent.
      </p>

      <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>
        I'd like greater resiliance and confidence in the face of difficult conversations. I started practising this in my last workplace and I'd like to 
        continue that journey. In a modern workplace, old-fashioned norms and biases need to be challenged and stamped out; there is no need for artificial
        constraints of old times whether this time, location, gender, age, or other.
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        I would like see the team maintain accountability. Likewise, to facilitate and encourage sharing of ideas and experiences. Likewise, to keep the focus 
        relevant and succinct.
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        Simply. I expect to be there and to be doing it. I want form a network of cohorts that will can contact me or vice versa once in the workforce for whatever reason.
