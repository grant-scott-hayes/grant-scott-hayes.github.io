      <h1> Learning Plan</h1>
      
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>I would like to remain in the Fintech space, perhaps in an organisation that utilises my knowledge in the fund/financial services industry however also open to anything bank, payments,
        or finance-operations. An ideal scenario would be a position that has the flexibility of significant periods of remote work (should I require that flexibility). 
      </p>

      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>I have a good track record in being able to learn new subjects and to apply that kwowledge. I am a good listener and am able to follow step-by-step instructions well.
        I sometimes have trouble when I am presented with very unfamiliar material and seem to take a bit longer than others to grasp the meaning; in that regard my cofidence
        can wane. Therefore, sometimes I do not do well in a time-crunch and find myself 'avoiding' if I don't have a reasonable understanding of the issue or problem domain. 
      </p>

      <h2>Non-technical skills</h2>
      <p>As an ongoing project, I will continue to challenge myself and work on my resilience under pressure. One aspect of Dev Academy that appealed
        for this very reason was the Bootcamp phase. In many regards it is a test of the work I have put in in the last few years overcoming stress-related issues
        and perservering to get the job done!
      </p>


      <h2>My Committment</h2>
      <p>I have a dedicated workspace to complete the work and having others rely on me will keep me on track to be available.</p>
      <p>I have been following strict improvements to my diet, excercise, and home environment to be the optimal for the upcoming bootcamp phase. I have 
        prepared an exclusive study area and will not be distracted in that zone. I have the apps on my mobile so will be available most times, even while away from a PC.</p>
      <p>I expect to be at the computer most days from 8:45am and will complete work systematically and be honest if I'm struggling. I will aim to complete the agreed 
        task-list when I promise to do so and keep others informed if that slipping.</p>

      <h3>Seeking help</h3>
      <p>I have had issues with stress in the past however that significantly improved in recent years and I have managed extremely stressful events since and I'm proud of the 
        resiliance I've shown. I will contact the facilitator, should any roadblocks come up.</p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>I would expect the faciliation team to offer experience, guidance, and reality checks; especially to help teams out of any rabbit-holes and to assist with technical roadblocks.</p>

      <h2>Block-outs</h2>
      <p>My calendar is clear so , none at this time in the bootcamp phase.</p>
