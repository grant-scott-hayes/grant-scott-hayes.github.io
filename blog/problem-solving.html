      <h2>A simple problem I was blocked on...</h2>
      
      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        As part of the learning excercies, DevAcademy cohorts are asked to complete a Javascript coding challenge called SuperFizzBUzz.
        it's a relatively simple problem testing the use of code structures to make logical decisions based on data. The aim is to 
        give a program numbers and it will return a "Fizz" on a number that is a multiple of 3, "Buzz" on a number that is a multiple of 5, 
        and "FizzBuzz" is the number is a multiple of both. <br> I chose to use a code structure called Switch which will test the number
        against a set of different cases and action the ones that match.<br> I thought I was being clever because you can omit breaks to
        allow the code to check out the next case even though another case match may have been found. That would have been fine but I did not
        know that the whole structure only evaluates the switch statement and not each case statement. So using an expression that 
        asks the switch structure to perform a secondary operation on each case won't work for example, case (expr % 3 == 0) is ignored and
        will never match the expr value which was a number in this case. 
      </p>

      <h3>what problem-solving techniques did I use?</h3>
      <p>
        To solve this problem I used console.logging inside each case to test if the code was matching the expr to the cases or not. When
        I used this, the console log output ws always empty so I was able to tell there was a problem with my structure. I then used Google 
        to check my syntax and work out what was going on. At that point I did not see the issue. The next step was to check if my peers
        had similar issues via Discord (our way of chatting to other cohorts online). From a couple of postings there, I realised that folk had been using if...else 
        structures to complete the excercise. I did a secondary Google search and found an entry on the forum called StackOverflow.com. Responses
        there to a similar problem showed me where I was going wrong (see picture). From there I scrapped the structure and changed to 
        If...Else statements and that worked perfectly.

      <h3>how did I feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Frustrated that the structure did not operate as I expected as it seemed to be correct in general terms. I also felt time pressures as I wanted 
        to complete the excercise in good time and within my timebox. Relieved to have discovered the issue and that it was a matter of chosing a 
        better tool for the job.
      </p> 
      
      <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
      <p>
        I learned that Javascript evaluates once and the cases don't evaluate expressions, as far as I know. I also learned that 
        Google can provide solutions very quickly although sometimes the results can be difficult to interpret. Additionally, there 
        many ways to achieve a result.

      <h2>A problem I elegantly solved....</h2>

      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        In this code example pictured, I was over happy with the solution as it was short and concise. I thought it was relatively elegant for my knowledge level, 
        however I was particularly happy with the filter line. The function was designed to filter out any words in the sentence that matched the 
        word "buzz". The tricky part was that it was case sensitive so any capital letters in the word buzz eg. Buzz, BuZZ would have been 
        ignored by the filiter if I'd only searched for "buzz". Instead of using all the possible combinations of capital and lower case 
        the word buzz, I simply converted the words to lowercase before checking against the filter value...that way capital letters in the sentence 
        were no longer an issue. 
      </p>

      <h3>what problem-solving techniques did I use?</h3>
      <p>
        I used console.log to test the filter function and how it behaved in relation to capital letters. I found that it was not 
        matching due to the capitalisation issue. I did trial and error test and console.log to see if the toLowerCase funtion solved the issue. I did
        also use Google to check the syntax of the filter method and to understand the arguments it needed or could have.
      </p> 
      
      <h3>how did I feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        I felt relatively good in the process although had the typical doubts about my understanding in the initial stages of the 
        problem set. The built in functions did not always behave in a manner that I found intuitive but I was releived when they achieved outcomes
        I hoped once I had all the compments in place.   
      </p> 
      
      <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
      <p>
        That filters are case sensitive. I also learned some more about the arrow notation to replace the function-bracket notation for 
        one line functions. I also learned that the built-in functions of javascript are vast and each data type in Javascript has some 
        super helpful built in methods that can save a lot of time and code.
