      <h1>Foundations - Reflections</h1>
      
      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        1. That I'm not the only one that has an inner critic attempting to take over my progress and roadblock my ambitions. <br>
        2. That my age and experience can be positive aspects to what I offer to the dev workforce.<br>
        3. That visualisation is a key tool when I am seeking to learn and become stronger at something.        
      </p> 

         
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
          We learnt more about this in the emotional intelligence module of foundations. It seems it can contribute signifacantly to overall success and
          satisfaction with life. Undeerlying that, self-awareness is linked with empathy and having core values conducive to healthy human interations. 
          In the context of learning the ability to listen and open your mind to new voices (that may be different to yours; with empathy) and new concepts 
          is an essential key skill or value to possess. The ability to be self-aware and accept your strengths and weaknesses, when presented with with foreign ideas or 
          situations, whether technical programming or social/personal interactions, may unblock your ability to form new ideas or see things in ways that others see it. 
          Likewise, having an awareness of the impact on other of your actions or reactions and internal biases may give you opportunities to make positive changes to 
          thos elements. In essence making the programming environment for you and your collegues safe zones for learning, acheivement, and team success.     
      </p> 
      
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I have been surprised by how much underlying knowledge I already have of some key concepts (albeit rusty and often vague). That has been a confidence boost at times.
        It is also surprising that I have had periods of feeling excitment for the bootcamp and the outcomes of that phase of DevAcademy.
      </p> 
      
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        The main chellenge was lagging energy for longer periods of engagement. I find that I do get tired with too much interaction with others and need to 
        recharge in a cave somewhere. The main goal is to keep engaged no matteer what level of energy I may be experiencing at the time. Another challenge has been the time
        management aspects. I have got a lot better with this but mainly need to use tools to start and stop in a timely fashion.
      </p> 
      

      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
        In the real world, the huamn skills are essential. In my experience of workplaces, the best and worst part of the job are the people and the culture. Yes, there 
        are challenges in the actual work however nothing kills productivity, creativity, job satisfaction, team morale, and enjoyment of life than difficult or toxic company 
        cultures. That is entirely in the hands of the leadership within an organisation. Not only do they 'set' the tone but they 'enable' the tone. A CEO that says the core values 
        are one thing but then allows misaligned behaviours, are just as culpable as those perpetrating the bad behaviours. Building a programming skills that builds in 
        emotional intelligence knowledge and skills prepare cohorts in the face of good and bad cultural experiences in the workplace. That resilience will allow them to 
        take a moment (to analyse the situation, empathise with individuals (or cultures), and decide a positive way forward.
      </p> 

        
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>
        No. I think they have been valuable primers and it sets the voice for the course. In my opinion, all organistions should go to great pains to have similar
        'cultural setups' for new recruits if they are truely serious about attracting and retaining quality humans for the organistion. The programming aspects will flow evetually 
        but getting into a collaborative, learning and growth mindset, seems a good way to spend time during the course.
