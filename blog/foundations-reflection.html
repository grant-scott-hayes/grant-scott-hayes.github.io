      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      
        <p>
        
      </p> 

         
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
        
        
      </p> 
      
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
       
      </p> 
      
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        
      </p> 
      

      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
        
      </p> 

  
      
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
