    <h1>Javascript (JS) - Technical Blog</h1>
    <p> A technical, non-technical blog post aimed at a better understanding of what I'm learning with examples of code and screenshots!</p>

    <h1>Javascript...what's that?</h1>
    <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h1>
    <p>Javascript (JS) is a programming language that can interact with web pages (and other programs or applications) to create highly flexible and/or dynamic web sites. It does this with 
    a special language (Javascript) that provides a set of instructions (scripts) for the web browser or other application(s) to follow. Often the <span class="terminology">instructions</span> tell the 
    webpage to load certain text, or styles (what the page looks like) depending on data it is given or is available about the computer, the user, or other information that may be stored and accessed by the 
    Javascript. It can also have instructions that allow the JScript to respond to user interactions with the web page or the web browser. For example, if the user moves the mouse over an area of
    the website, the JS may change the colour of that area because it's been instructed to "listen" for that type of mouse movement. So the website can essentially look and behave very differently
    based on the many different sets of instructions and data made avialable to the Javascript while the browser is running.</p>
    
    <p>Within the context of a web site Javascript is therefore interacting with the HTML and the CSS elements that make up the structure, content, and look and feel of a webpage. HTML and CSS both 
    contribute as the basic building blocks that the user of a website can see and interact with. Interaction with a webbrowser takes many forms but common inputs may be touch screens (including phones, tablets, etc), 
    keyboards, mouse, camera, microphones, pointers, and others; and, output devices like screens, speakers, storage areas/devices, printers, and many others. Hence ineractions can be diverse and varied.</p>
    
  <p>Javascript, by analogy, is like having a home builder (web programmer) hire a head contractor (Javascript) to instruct and monitor a team of trades, painters, musicians, and more to build and furnish a house 
    based on those instructions as a new home owner/visitor (webpage visitor) arrives at the house. </p>
    
    <p>However, instead of the house being set a certain way whether size, colour, shape, layout, furnished or unfurnished, etc. it instead is the framework of a house (html/CSS) that can change based on the 
    instructions the head contractor has available to instruct the trades to follow (dependong on their respective tool kits). As a person approaches the house the head contractor gathers information and instructs 
    tradies to get ready and then uses instruction sheets to make things happen to the house depending on the scope of the instruction sheet. Maybe the head contractor knows something about the person approaching, 
    or makes decisions based on the vehicle they arrive in, or the person may have a information sheet (workorder) of their own they hand over or ask the head to get from another source. So the house may 
    become an ultra modern building, with green walls and a red roof, and play a song from the users Spotify playlist, and inside the user has a roast beef meal waiting because that's what they wrote on a piece 
    of paper at the start and gave to the head contractor. In essense, the house is an empty frame that can be identified using standard building material names, groups of materials, or individually named parts 
    (just like HTML and CSS are the elements of a website) and the head contractor (Javascript) can instruct various trades to make changes to those parts depending on instructions of a designer (web programmer).

    <h1>Control Flow and Loops...what are they?</h2>
    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
    <p>In Javascript, the set of instructions (scripts) are read and followed by the computer from the top to the bottom of the page. This is the natural <span class="terminology">Control Flow</span>of Javascript. 
    However, if JS encounters a special instruction that asks JS to jump to a different set in instructions somewhere differnt on the page or into a different file, or to repeat repeat the given instruction, the 
    Control Flow will jump to the new spot and the scripts in the new area will be read from top to bottom until instructed to return to the original spot or go elsewhere or to stop all together.</p>

    <p>The types of instructions that can ask the script to alter the top to bottom flow take many forms but common methods to change the Control Flow are <span class="terminology">loops (repeating code a number of times); 
      conditional statements (perform different actions based on certain logical choices); function calls (specific purpose blocks of code that can be utlised by other blocks of code)</span>.</p>

    <p>Loops, are useful for repeating code until all items the code is using have been processed, or a certain condition becomes true or false whether it's the number of times a loop is performed, whether 
      a value or itme is found in the set of items being scrutinised by the loop. Typical loop statement would look like this:</p> 
      
    <img src="/images/Loop-Example.jpg">
    
    <p>The basic typical syntax is illustrated. It's made up of a variable that keeps count of the loops, a condition the loop uses to decide when to stop, and the way the loop iterates the loop counter. The control 
      flow is top to bottom with the loop testing the condition at the start of each loop before deciding to run the code each time. There are other typoes of loops that essesntially run with execute with slightly 
      different logic. These include <span class="terminology">Do-while loops</span> and <span class="terminology">while loops</span> - similar with slightly different timings of the testing of the condition.
    </p>

    <p>The other flow controls are not discussed in this document.</p>
    
    <p>A simple analogy of Control Flow in JS, would be baking a cake. You read a receipe from top to bottom and follow the recipe instructions step by step however at certain points in the recipe you may be 
      required to perform a sub-task that is necessary for the recipe but has a whole other set of instructions not mentioned at that point in the recipe. Providing specialised instructions about the oven or tasks 
      that are repeatsed often would clog up the receipe unnecessarily. For example, heat the oven, is a simple reference to the actions associated with turning the oven on, turning dials on the oven, getting it up
      to temperature, etc. The inner wokrings of the oven are unknown to the cook but the recipe allows the cook to step out of the recipe to get the oven ready and then return once complete. An example, where a control 
      loop might come into play is 'stir the mixture ten times'. The cook would then be expected to count the number of times they stirred the mixture, and keep stirring until the number of stirs reached ten, then stop and move?
      to the next part of the recipe.
