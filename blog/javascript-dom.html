    <h1>Javascript (JS) - Technical Blog</h1>
    <p> A technical, non-technical blog post aimed at a better understanding of what I'm learning with examples of code and screenshots!</p>

    <h1>Javascript...what's that?</h1>
    <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h1>
    <p>Javascript (JS) is a programming language that can interact with web pages (and other programs or applications) to create highly flexible and/or dynamic web sites. It does this with 
    a special language (Javascript) that provides a set of instructions (scripts) for the web browser or other application(s) to follow. Often the <span class="terminology">instructions</span> tell the 
    webpage to load certain text, or styles (what the page looks like) depending on data it is given or is available about the computer, the user, or other information that may be stored and accessed by the 
    Javascript. It can also have instructions that allow the JScript to respond to user interactions with the web page or the web browser. For example, if the user moves the mouse over an area of
    the website, the JS may change the colour of that area because it's been instructed to "listen" for that type of mouse movement. So the website can essentially look and behave very differently
    based on the many different sets of instructions and data made avialable to the Javascript while the browser is running.</p>
    
    <p>Within the context of a web site Javascript is therefore interacting with the HTML and the CSS elements that make up the structure, content, and look and feel of a webpage. HTML and CSS both 
    contribute as the basic building blocks that the user of a website can see and interact with. Interaction with a webbrowser takes many forms but common inputs may be touch screens (including phones, tablets, etc), 
    keyboards, mouse, camera, microphones, pointers, and others; and, output devices like screens, speakers, storage areas/devices, printers, and many others. Hence ineractions can be diverse and varied.</p>
    
  <p>Javascript, by analogy, is like having a home builder (web programmer) hire a head contractor (Javascript) to instruct and monitor a team of trades, painters, musicians, and more to build and furnish a house 
    based on those instructions as a new home owner/visitor (webpage visitor) arrives at the house. </p>
    
    <p>However, instead of the house being set a certain way whether size, colour, shape, layout, furnished or unfurnished, etc. it instead is the framework of a house (html/CSS) that can change based on the 
    instructions the head contractor has available to instruct the trades to follow (dependong on their respective tool kits). As a person approaches the house the head contractor gathers information and instructs 
    tradies to get ready and then uses instruction sheets to make things happen to the house depending on the scope of the instruction sheet. Maybe the head contractor knows something about the person approaching, 
    or makes decisions based on the vehicle they arrive in, or the person may have a information sheet (workorder) of their own they hand over or ask the head to get from another source. So the house may 
    become an ultra modern building, with green walls and a red roof, and play a song from the users Spotify playlist, and inside the user has a roast beef meal waiting because that's what they wrote on a piece 
    of paper at the start and gave to the head contractor. In essense, the house is an empty frame that can be identified using standard building material names, groups of materials, or individually named parts 
    (just like HTML and CSS are the elements of a website) and the head contractor (Javascript) can instruct various trades to make changes to those parts depending on instructions of a designer (web programmer).

    <h1>Control Flow and Loops...what are they?</h2>
    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
    <p>In Javascript, the set of instructions (scripts) are read and followed by the computer from the top to the bottom of the page. This is the natural <span class="terminology">Control Flow</span>of Javascript. 
    However, if JS encounters a special instruction that asks JS to jump to a different set in instructions somewhere differnt on the page or into a different file, or to repeat repeat the given instruction, the 
    Control Flow will jump to the new spot and the scripts in the new area will be read from top to bottom until instructed to return to the original spot or go elsewhere or to stop all together.</p>

    <p>The types of instructions that can ask the script to alter the top to bottom flow take many forms but common methods to change the Control Flow are <span class="terminology">loops (repeating code a number of times); 
      conditional statements (perform different actions based on certain logical choices); function calls (specific purpose blocks of code that can be utlised by other blocks of code)</span>.</p>

    <p>Loops, are useful for repeating code until all items the code is using have been processed, or a certain condition becomes true or false whether it's the number of times a loop is performed, whether 
      a value or itme is found in the set of items being scrutinised by the loop. Typical loop statement would look like this:</p> 
      
    <img src="/images/Loop-Example.jpg">
    
    <p>The basic typical syntax is illustrated. It's made up of a variable that keeps count of the loops, a condition the loop uses to decide when to stop, and the way the loop iterates the loop counter. The control 
      flow is top to bottom with the loop testing the condition at the start of each loop before deciding to run the code each time. There are other typoes of loops that essesntially run with execute with slightly 
      different logic. These include <span class="terminology">Do-while loops</span> and <span class="terminology">while loops</span> - similar with slightly different timings of the testing of the condition.
    </p>

    <p>The other flow controls are not discussed in this document.</p>
    
    <p>A simple analogy of Control Flow in JS, would be baking a cake. You read a receipe from top to bottom and follow the recipe instructions step by step however at certain points in the recipe you may be 
      required to perform a sub-task that is necessary for the recipe but has a whole other set of instructions not mentioned at that point in the recipe. Providing specialised instructions about the oven or tasks 
      that are repeatsed often would clog up the receipe unnecessarily. For example, heat the oven, is a simple reference to the actions associated with turning the oven on, turning dials on the oven, getting it up
      to temperature, etc. The inner wokrings of the oven are unknown to the cook but the recipe allows the cook to step out of the recipe to get the oven ready and then return once complete. An example, where a control 
      loop might come into play is 'stir the mixture ten times'. The cook would then be expected to count the number of times they stirred the mixture, and keep stirring until the number of stirs reached ten, then stop and move?
      to the next part of the recipe.

    <h1>The DOM...the what and How to DOM?</h1>
    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
    <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is Javascripts representation of the structure of a website for the purposes of accessing items for use in Javascript code.</p>
    <p>The DOM can be visualised as a family tree or organisational chart that holds all the parts of a web page in a heirachical structure with parents up the top and children branching off parents underneath.</p>

    <img src="/images/DOM-tree.jpg">source: www.kirupa.com

    <p>The elements in the tree are called <span class="terminology">nodes</span>. Each item in an HTML document is on the tree somewhere and is a child node of a parent node higher up the tree. You can 
    find and access all the information about an item in the tree and therefore can makde changes to them once found. Finding an item can be done in several ways but in short you can either refer to an 
    item by its id name or by reference to it's place in a group of items that are referred to by their grouping (maybe they belong to the same class, or are all children of the same node, or are an element in the of the
    same type like 'h1' headings, or in the 'divs' tag. Some examples of referencing items to then access details, change them, or handle them in code are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>document.querySelector("#hello") : this would refer to a specific single element with id="hello" on the HTML document</li>
      <li>document.querySelector(".pictureContainer") : this would refer to the first element using the class="pictureContainer" on the HTML document</li>
      <li>----</li>
      <li>document.querySelectorAll(".pictureCOntainer") : this would bring backa nodelist of all the elements using the class="pictureContainer" on the HTML document</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once you've found and returned a nodes or nodes, you can then go about modifying them by accessing the methods, and properties of the node using Javascript. It's a matter 
      of learning what tools to use to change the values of the nodes. Common modifications might be updating the text displayed on a page based on a data source, or perhaps
      user input or interactions with the page, or changes to the CSS to restyle element sof the page whether simple colour schemes or more complex attributes.   
    </p>

    <p>One of the great things about JS is that it can be directed to modify anything in the DOM. This includses adding an removing elements of a webpage, adding, changing, and removing attributes of 
      elements. This includes CSS classes an element refers to to and uses, and more. The CSS classes themselves can be added, removed, and modified by JavaScript so the possibilities are vast.   
    </p>

    <h1>Accessing Arrays Vs Objects...the what and how to DOM?</h1>
    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
    <p>An array is a basically an indexed set of conatiners for data or objects that can be referred to by the name of the array. On the simple end, the containers may hold single numbers or text values, or on 
      the more complex side, each container may refer to whole objects or indeed a whole array (an array of arrays!). To access individual items in the array you can refer to the position the container occupies in the 
    array. Items in an array are addedd to sequential positions starting from zero upwards. So the first item is arryName[0], the second is arryName[1], and so on. Each addition adds to that index.</p>

    <p>An array is created by delaring it in the code using the name of the array followed by square brackets eg. let thisArray = []. Arrays can be looped through to perform actions on the containers whether that's retrieving data from the array, adding to it, doing calculations, moving items around, and so on. It
      is particularily useful because the index number used to access the array data is numeric and easy to increment and decrement with counting variables comminly used in control loops. 
    </p>

    <p>On the other hand Objects are complex structures that can be programmed to have properties and methods data. This means that they can be constructed to hold data and perform functions. 
      To code up an object data properties can be created, as well as function that perform tasks when called.
    </p>

    <p>Objects can be referenced by name and passed around in code using the name of the object. To access the properties and methods of objects you can use the dot approach eg. objectName.lastName or using
      bracket notation like ojbectName["lastName"].
    </p>

    <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h1>
    <p>Functions are reusable snippets of code that can be referenced by name within Javascript. They can be provided data to use within the code snippet and return a value back to the calling code for 
      assignment to variables if reuired. They are considered reusable as they can be called at any time to perform a repeatable task used by different parts of the code without having to repeat the 
      code at the point it is required. Examples may be to check if a user is logged in. A small function may be used to check the status of a user login and return a true/false value back to the 
      calling code.
    </p>

    <p>By analogy, a function is a bit like having an endless supply of pre-prepared meals in the freezer. Instead of cooking up the meal each time from scratch, you simply put it in the microwave and out comes meal.
