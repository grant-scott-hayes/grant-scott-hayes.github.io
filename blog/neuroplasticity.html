        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        
        <p><span>It seems clear from the readings and underlying research that understanding the principles of neuroplasticity would lead to a choice; the choice to engage and practise ways to develop a </span><span style="font-style:italic">Growth Mindset</span>. Having such a mindset would potentially unlock greater personal achievement, greater satisfaction in life, and a greater sense of free will. This stems from the &nbsp;use of what are considered more positive traits such as persistence, mastery, resilience, as well as the ability to take on challenges, take criticism, and learn from others. Having knowledge of the main principles of neuroplasticity would enable a person to engage in methods and techniques that are likely to engage neural circuits in the brain thus result in changes for the better. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        
        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ways that I engage is to increase the structure in my life especially where it has been lacking. This would be in the form of more established routines and incremental improvements in lifestyle and learning. Always a work in progress and by no means well established, but having habits and routines will enrich my life otherwise, I will waste my time in idleness! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span>By doing this I should be engaging many of the principles of neuroplasticity that lead to positive change. Through planning and structure I can introduce and tackle many of the key principles concurrently. Obviously, I’ll be performing tasks or study that require me to dedicate </span><span style="font-style:italic">time</span><span>&nbsp;to learning and growth, and I’ll inherently be making time available in a habitual manner to </span><span style="font-style:italic">use it rather than lose it.</span><span>&nbsp;Structuring then introduces opportunities for </span><span style="font-style:italic">Repetition </span><span>of what I want/need to practise</span><span>, </span><span style="font-style:italic">Salience</span><span>&nbsp;of the content I plan to cover, as well </span><span style="font-style:italic">Specificity</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span style="font-style:italic">Generalisation </span>by practising real world examples into my study. I naturally think retrospectively when learning new content, asking myself, “How would I have used this in previous jobs or task sets” whereby the imagination can be as powerful as the practical.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?<br></h2>
        
        <p><span>Similar to the discussion above, the way I feel I can improve my neuroplasticity is through small changes that lead to big overall change. For me, I can start things but it’s then about persistence. I like the idea of </span><span style="font-style:italic">starting small, proving your ability to yourself in a thousand tiny ways, and letting the confidence and growth mindset naturally follow from there</span>. I know that regular activities lead to a huge amount of satisfaction. In this regard I have already started in many small ways, going to the gym, enrolling with DevAcademy, and preparing healthy meals. There are many more things that are on the list including maths study, regular walks, time blocking study, regular waking times, and more. </p>

        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        
        
        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
        
        <p>A “growth mindset,” has five key characteristics as outlined by Carol Dweck. A growth mindset thrives on challenge, is persistent in the face of setbacks, considers effort as a path to mastery, will learn from criticism and mistakes, and is willing to learn from others. These characteristics are relevant because they can lead to behaviours that have a material impact on a person’s success or failure both professionally and personally.</p>
        
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        
        <p><span>Yes, I was surprised (and dismayed) while examining my relationship to the concepts, that many aspects of my mindset are fixed and hence need significant amounts of work and unlocking. <br><br>Although many aspects of my pursuits are in the </span><span style="font-style:italic">Growth Mindset</span>&nbsp;camp, this review provides a framework for change, and that in itself is positive change. Creating that awareness is a step toward personal development. </p>
        
        <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        
        <p>In the past I have ‘run away’ from challenges. In the context of learning, I want to tackle everything head on; essentially fighting the fear of failure or perception of being judged. Underlying this is to let go of external measures of success. The success I will derive from my learning plan is about becoming one with the Growth Mindset philosophy as I believe there is greater benefit from that - all else becomes relatively immaterial!</p>

        <h1>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
        
        
        <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
        
        <p><span>I like the core principles of the </span><span style="font-style:italic">Growth Mindset</span><br>&nbsp;and I would like to incorporate them into my learning plan and strategies much like a ‘core values’ statement. In that regard, reminding myself daily that, if I follow a framework that is fronting up, putting in the effort, taking the hits, and learning from others, mastery will follow…eventually! <br><br>In terms of the practical shape of my learning plan, a weekly planning session on a Sunday to time-block more is in order. Included in those blocks will be those elements of life I think add value to my well-being like exercise, social aspects, learning, practise (like typing), and so on.<br></p>
