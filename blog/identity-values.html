      <h2>Core Values</h2>

      <h3>Integrity, Honesty, and Safety</h3>
      <p>In all aspects of life, I value honesty and integrity (alongside kindness) to support safe environments for open and truthful discussion. I apply this to all aspects of life whether personal, 
        societal, or work/business relationships.</p>
      <h3>Open-mindedness</h3>
      <p>Related to the above, I try my best to revisit my reactions or thoughts to people, situations, or information. I try to listen and allow myself to see and hear without too many personal 
      biases distracting me. I don't think everything is black and white, rather I have a 'shades-in-between' philosophy; I reserve the right to be able to have a different opinion tomorrow!</p>
      
      <h3>Minimalism</h3>
      <p>I value simplicity and having simple pleasures in life. I'd like to have an extensive garden, experience the seasons, and have the company of thoughtful souls!  </p>
      
      <h3>Self-Care</h3>
      <p>Following a relatively healthy lifestyle, keep mobile, and enjoy natural highs.</p>
      
      <h2>An ethical decision</h2>
      
      <p>As a landlord, I often face ethical decisions when setting rents, or making decisions about maintenance requirements on a property and what impact that will have 
        on the tenants in the property. It does require balancing financial aspects of owning an investment against ethical decisions including such things as legal obligations, affordability, 
        enjoyment of the tenants, the stress on families today, and so on. One time I put a house on the market for sale and I had to decide if I would ask the tenants of six years
        to leave or not. If they left, I could present the house in a better way for sale and possibly get more money for it, or they could stay, endure the open homes, and I'd collect a smaller rent
        during that time. It would also give them the possibility of a continued tenancy if another landlord purchased the place. I chose the later because I did not feel asking the tenant to 
        suddenly leave for the uncertainty of a house sale was worth the disruption to their lives. The consequence was that the house wasn't presented well and I was offered lower than expected prices for the house and I 
        decided not to sell. The tenants stayed are still there three years later and it made me happy that I didn;t have to terminate the tenancy of a lovely family group.     
      </p> 

      <h2>Cultural influences on values and identity.</h2>
      
      <h3>TV and film</h3>
      <p>Growing up in my family in the 1980's there was a lot of influence from TV especially much seemed to glorify America and The American Dream ucluding ideals like consumerism, wealth and entrepreneurship, 
      and sickly-sweet family sitcoms espousing moral lessons. This version of success seemed to be the prevailing one culturally when I was growing up and looking back it felt that the pursuit of money 
      and wealth was what made a person successful. No doubt I was influenced but I'm not a fan of this; I don't value owning stuff so aim for a fairly minimalistic life.</p>
      
      <h3>The family business</h3>
      <p>Ironically, I grew up in an entrepreneurial household where my parents were self-employed for significant periods of time in various hospitality businesses. I didn't mind working 
      in the businesses and learnt many, many life skills as a result, although it did mean we moved around a lot (my father wasn't a particularly good businessman). Hence, I experienced many 
      different townships and schools, plus the hardships of their small-business ownership (and failure). With them being pre-occupied with that, I developed a strong sense of independence 
      and the desire to not follow in their foot-steps. Likewise, all the moving we did meant I experienced a diverse range of cultures and attitudes in smaller towns of NZ from, Kaitaia to 
      Gore, as well as bigger cities. Without the entrepreneurial aspect still influence me, but at the same time so does risk-aversion and realism, and the desire to avoid the financial 
      failures of my parents.</p>
      
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>Education was not valued by my parents so I was not aware of the possibilities of university. It wasn't until realised I didn't want the same lifestyle and experiences 
      as my parents that I gained an interest in university and higher-education in my late teens. I funded myself through university and enjoyed the learning, the sense of achievement, 
      and the independence it afforded me. I value education for the ability for it to broaden horizons, create opportunity, and to break cycles.</p>   
      
      <h3>Overseas experiences</h3>
      <p>Going overseas in the late 1990's was relatively spontaneous but the best decision I have ever made. Much like university, it broadened my outlook significantly, 
      and gave me perspective on life in New Zealand. Although, I like aspects of New Zealand I don't I identify particularly strongly with many of our societal norms. My children 
      live overseas and I value the global experience they are getting in a culturally diverse city including lifestyle, languages, and meeting other global-minded teens.</p>
      
      <h3>Parenthood</h3>
      <p>I've taken many of the experiences and perceptions I had of my parents and family life and deliberately turned them on their head. I value their opinion, their 
      growing independence, and my the early realisation that they aren't limited by real or artificial borders! </p> 
      
      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
      
      <h3>Some Findings</h3> 
      
      <h4>DOPE Analysis...</h4>
      <p>Dove 35%</p>
      <p>The peaceful dove. The dove is people-orientated, loyal, friendly, hard-working and a great team player but tends to avoid change, confrontation, risk-taking and assertiveness.</p>
      
      <h4>Owl 35%</h4>
      <p>The wise owl. The owl is logical, mathematically minded, methodical and sometimes seen as a perfectionist. The owl can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if rules and logic says 
        otherwise. Owls are not big risk takers but love detail.</p>
      
      <h4>Myer Briggs Finding: INTJ...</h4>
      
      <p>In terms of career choice, being an INTJ appears to support doing a technical careers that involve creative and social aspects (like web development and entrepreneurship). 
      <span class="terminology"> “Successful INTJs are found in technological companies, particularly in research and development, and among corporate lawyers, high- and mid-rank managers in technology companies 
      and financial institutions.”</span></p>
      
      <p>In terms of learning style, it's suggested that I should do well at Dev Academy because the learning appears to be  systematic and intensive, presented on a conceptual basis (with practical applications)
      , moderately paced, from different viewpoints or using various examples, with some amount of repetition. I however may struggle at times with the fast pace of the material in Dev Academy if the material 
      is a little vague or trivial, or with the material requiring strong emotional reactions (Core?).</p>
       
      <p>This outlook is supported somewhat with the findings of the Strengthsfinder exercise which suggested my strengths include coaching, thoughtfulness, catalysing, finding solutions, and keeping focus. 
        These seem more aligned to helping and supporting others in to achieve outcomes. In terms of the DevAcademy environment, I am sure these skills may be required during the intensity of the bootcamp phase.</p>
      
        <p>I've identified that I may have limitations if I don't maintain a clear pathway (or goals) that keep me on track. The question of 'why' will need to be keep firmly in my grasp to avoid becoming confused
           by my motivations! Likewise, will my lower levels of assertiveness hinder my ability to influence decisions in a team-environment. I am able to communicate well, but in the face of persuasive teams
            members, I'll need to keep an on whether I am compromising in order to keep the peace.</p>
      
      <h2>A snapshot of my Acheivements</h2>
      
      <p>Breaking cycles and social norms!</p>
      <p>Education and learning</p>
            
      <h2>Experience Example</h2>

      <p>In a work environment, an on-boarding project involving a new customer and a signifcant body of new work for the team once live, was not being managed well by the operations manager. 
        This was causing a huge amount of stress and confusion for the teams involved. It was mainly due to a lack of communicaiton and a toxic work environment created by the manager.
      It got the time where where everyone gave up waiting on guidnance and the team got together to self-help. Attempts to engage the manager failed. It was creating a huge amount of chatter and distraction and
    there was a clear lack of leadership in a time-crunch situation.</p>
    <p>The team decided to get together and decide how to proceed without the involvement of the manager. We offered to assist the lead of the project assistance and we brainstormed, 
      determined the flow of work and testing, how things would operate in the go-live phase, and we proceeded to action the plan. It was a great morale booster and it created a feeling
      of relief for the team. The plan was then to go to the manager with the team efforts and show how we were willing to provide all the support needed as a team. The strategy was one of team empowerment, buy-in,
    and communication. Unfortunately, it was not perceived this way by the manager.</p>
    <p>Instead, he was upset at our efforts. He lost his temper and began a series of one-on-one, closed door sessions with individuals (some were in tears) effectively to 'tell people off'. It completely undid all the team morale and caused a 
      huge amount of distrust and confusion amoungst the team. In my discussion with the manager, I was very clear on the positives of the actions of the team and how it was beneficial to the customer and the morale of 
      the team. My strategy was to be honest, and to focus on the positives. Overall, the failure seemed to be in failing to get his buy-in before hand (regardless of perior attempts).
      I was that dismayed at the horrible attitude of the manager that I resigned shortly after.</p>

    <p>On reflection, although I fundamentally believe that the manager was incompetent and wrong to react as he did, it was up to us as a team to recognise the nature of his character and use communication 
      to our advantage. Although, time was on the essence, there was more time wasted cleaning up the social aftermath than doing the work. Clearly, he felt attacked and sought to dissolve any threats or the 
      empowerment of the team. In future, I would consider the management style in the strategy and decide if there needs to be an additional layer of buy-in upwards as well as downwards. Likewise, on reflection, I'd
      also, consider going the other way and using it as a way to push for change - instead of allowing the isolation and diversion, to present as a united front against that type of toxic management.
