      <p>What is Emotional Intelligence?

      Daniel Goleman - Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.
      
      Five Components:
      
      Self-Awareness - essentially, you 'know yourself' including the identification, awareness and understanding of your own behavoural patterns, emotions, and motivations, and in what way they impact those around you. 
      Knowing the cause or what 'sets you off', what are the good and not-so-good behaviours or responses, can allow you to temper them, improve, eliminate, or accept them.
      
      Self-Regulation - if you are self-aware, this can lead to self-regulation. Self-regulation is the ability to assess or take a breath, control your response with prior consideration for the impact.
      It is having the ability to make positive choices for yourself and others on how you’re going to respond to the emotions, thoughts, and feelings you experience. There are a number of methods that can 
      assist with self-regualtion. Some examples may include activities such as deep breathing, professional therapy, sensory grounding excercises, mindfulness techniques, acceptance though observation and feedback, and self-challenges or changing the story you tell yourself. 
      
       
      Motivation
      This is where you are motivated to achieve a definition of success that comes from within, through self development and personal growth, rather than the threat of punishment or extrinsis rewards such as money. It is 
      essentially driven by personal satisfaction rather than external measures of success. 
      
      Empathy
      This is the ability to put effort into understanding the experience of others around you without 'leaping to conclusions', 'judging a book by it's cover', and other such saying about judgement. People without this 
      ability tend to be self-centred and won't care for the other side of the story which often sets the scene for conflict, dysfunction, and negative outcomes and power imbalances. "We listen to and respect their 
      truth—without judging it, without trying to eliminate it, without trying to change it." (Whitney Hess) 
      
      Social Skills
      This is about openness to conversation and engagement with other around you. You bring to the table the other skills of self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and motivation.
      You recognise that you are only a part of a two-way exchange where you are aware of the context of the exchange and understand what is appropriate.  
      
      
      How is it different to IQ?
      IQ is a measure of a person's ability to solve problems, grasp complex ideas, and use logic. This is diffderent to emotional intelligence which measures 
      your ability to gauge emotion in yourself and others, and then to use that awareness in your responses. A high IQ score means you have a higher than average ability 
      to reason and solve problems however your level of emotional intelligence is likely to contribute in your ability to make social connections, communicate and share ideas, and 
      to motivate others. Neither alone is likely to be a measure of success. 
      
      Why is it important?
      It seems common sence that a natural outcome of practising the five main components of Emotional Intelligence ought to lead to better outcomes in life whether they are good or bad events. 
      Suddies seem to support this notion; that higher emotional intelligence leads to better quality relationships, higher levels of success and satisfaction in your personal and work life, and more success in co-operative environments where you 
      have a positive influence on those around you so particularly powerful in group settings.
